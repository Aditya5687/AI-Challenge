INTERVIEW TASK - CROP TYPE CLASSIFICATION


Task - Crop type classification with satellite data involves using multispectral imagery and machine learning algorithms to identify and categorize different crops across large agricultural areas. This process aids in precision agriculture, allowing for informed decisions on crop health, yield estimation, and land-use planning.

Objective - The objective of this task is to assess the candidate's proficiency in Python, handling geospatial data, visualization, and analysis within Jupyter Notebooks. You are provided with the URL of a GitHub repository containing Jupyter Notebooks focused on geospatial analysis. Your task is to replicate the contents of the notebooks named "Data_Preprocessing.ipynb" and "NDVI.ipynb". Certain SUBTASKS have been embedded in both the notebooks which have to be done to ensure end to end working of the notebooks.

Instructions :
1. Use Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab for the replication.
2. Install all the required libraries prior to attempting the task.
3. Document the replicated code with comments wherever required.
4. Complete all SUBTASKS.
5. Pay attention to the order of code cells and maintain the spatial context.
6. Submit the replicated notebooks as a compressed archive within the given time frame.

Data Description - The Layer Stack of Bands data has been created by stacking 5 layers in the following order :
1. Layer 1 --> Band 2 Reflectance
2. Layer 2 --> Band 3 Reflectance
3. Later 3 --> Band 4 Reflectance
4. Layer 4 --> Band 5 Reflectance
5. Layer 5 --> Band 8 Relfectance

Additional Notes :
1. Prior to attempting the task, read up on Geospatial Data to familiarise yourself with common terminology and workings of this      domain like rasters, vectors, coordinate sytems, etc.
2. You can add your own code cells additional to the ones already present wherever needed.
2. For any questions, you can mail them to the given id - siddham@arms4ai.com
